# Restaurant-Page

A simple restaurant page. The goal in creating this site is to learn how to use modules, webpack, and npm/package.json.

Things Learned:
1. Separation of files and content via modules. Each section of the site (home, menu, contact) having its own module that loads the content to the index.html.
